# Insta_Auto_Update_Bio_GUI

**Use only the .py file, the .sh is for linux and doesn't provide full functionality**

Updates Instagram bio with time alive from your anniversary and a phrase automatically

Script uses browser GUI because Instagram doesn't give us any good API

# Installation

Requieres python installed  
and library:  
`pip install pyautogui`

# Usage

It's going to change the Bio from the account logged in in your default browser. If none's logged in, it's just gonna do weird stuff

`python -u "c:\path\to\script"`
